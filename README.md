  <h1>Overwatch League: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
  <h3>Welcome to the Competitive World of Overwatch</h3>
  <p><a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/game/overview/">Overwatch</a> is a 6v6 team-based shooter videogame made by Activision Blizzard.  It has sold over 25 million copies and been received extremely well by fans and critics all over the world.  Overwatch League (OWL) is Blizzard's proprietary Overwatch ecosystem where organizations will buy team slots in 12 cities and compete with each other. It is just like sports, except in this space, we call them e-sports! Think of it like the NBA or NFL, just on a smaller scale. </p>
